# notes-website
Udacity project to create a website.

A simple website recording topics learned and demonstrating some of the skills and knowledge acquired over
the course of the Intro to Programming nanodegree. I used Python for the back end, Jinja2 for the HTML templates,
Google Datastore for enabling comments, and Google App Engine for hosting.

The website URL is here: http://polar-pillar-97418.appspot.com/
