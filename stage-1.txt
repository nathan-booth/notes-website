The Web

The World Wide Web is a collection of connected HTML documents. HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and it defines the rules for transferring files among computers, servers, and software (like browsers) on the web.

HTML

HTML stands for hypertext markup language; it is the code behind HTML documents that tells computers and browsers what information to display. An element of HTML is composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, except in the case of void tags which do not require a closing tag. Elements are either inline or block; the latter forms a box around the content inside. Tags are often assigned attributes which change the functionality of an element, such as color or creating a link.

Words to Work By

In general, don't worry about memorizing bits of code; anything you haven't memorized by common use is easily found with a Google search or common resources, like w3schools or Stack Overflow.
