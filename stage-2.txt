Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM refers to the tree-like or nested structure of HTML documents. A web page can be viewed as a series of nested boxes in which content resides. Properly structured code uses indentation to reflect the organization of the boxes.

Tools

Chrome and other browsers have developer tools that can be used to inspect the code behind a web page.
Text editors like Sublime Text are used to write code because they make life for a programmer a bit easier by automatically completing bits of code, identifying syntax errors, and more.
